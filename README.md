# student-notebook
This is a project that is being done as a part of my course work in web and database programming Fall 2022.

**Introduction of the project:**
1. This project is used to take notes by each user.
2. Each user of this app can register with the details and login to start creating the notes.
3. Each Note is linked with the user using the userId.
4. Only one user can create one note.

The below screenshot is the ER Diagram of this project.
